We are a soil microbial ecology lab investigating how management practices, land-use change, 
and environmental drivers (e.g., climate change, nutrient dynamics, and contamination) shape 
soil-microbe-plant interactions across terrestrial ecosystems. Our research focuses on the 
mechanisms through which these interactions regulate biogeochemical cycling, modulate abiotic 
and biotic stress, and influence biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and resilience. Ultimately, 
we aim to advance environmental sustainability and inform One Health–relevant outcomes by linking 
belowground microbial processes to plant performance and ecosystem services.
