I'm an assistant professor of microbial ecology in the College of Agriculture, Environmental and Human Sciences (CAEHS) at Lincoln University. 

My research investigates how management practices, land-use change, and environmental drivers (e.g., climate change, nutrient dynamics, and contamination) shape soil–microbe–plant interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. I am especially interested in how these interactions regulate biogeochemical cycling, buffer abiotic and biotic stress, enhance biodiversity, advance environmental sustainability, and support One Health outcomes.
