Very happy to see this paper **["Sustainable intensification with winter crops stimulates soil nitrogen availability and microbially-mediated N cycling but does not result in substantial benefits to subsequent corn"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00374-025-01967-5)** published in *Biology and Fertility of Soils*. We found that replacing fallow with winter cover crops provided limited benefits to subsequent corn yields, but significantly altered microbially mediated N transformations.
